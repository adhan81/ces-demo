# 🚀 Quick Deploy to GitHub

I've set everything up! Just need you to create the repository, then I'll push the code.

## Step 1: Create Repository (30 seconds)

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name:** `ces-demo`
3. **Make it:** Public ✅
4. **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README"
5. **Click:** "Create repository"

## Step 2: I'll Push the Code

Once you've created the repo, let me know and I'll push everything!

Or if you want to push manually:
```bash
cd /Users/asifdhanani/Documents/SimpleAgent/ces-demo
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

After the code is pushed:
1. Go to: https://github.com/asifdhanani/ces-demo/settings/pages
2. Under "Source":
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
3. Click "Save"
4. Wait 1-2 minutes
5. Your site: **https://asifdhanani.github.io/ces-demo/**

**Everything is ready to go!** Just create the repo and I'll handle the rest! 🎉
